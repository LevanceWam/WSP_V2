			<h2>Dates</h2>
			<p>This is here to let the user know what events are going on and the dates that they are going to happen on .</p>
			<h2>Content Visualization</h2>
			<p>The first Thing I would that is here is a section tag to hold all of the content. Then right after this it would put my h1 - h6 tag here.
			Next comes 3 separate article tags and each of them would have one div.Then a h1-h6 tag followed by a paragraph Tag.

			<h2>Content Visualization</h2>
			<p>This Component has a 2 articles that are within a section. Within the articles is a img tag. After that I would have to say there
			was a two span/anchor tags that show the tags that relate to the article.Following that would be  is possibly a h1 tag and the a em tag under that
				next up would be the paragraph tag and finally the anchor tag with css styling.
