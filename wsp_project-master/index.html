			<h2>Content Visualization</h2>
			<p>The first Thing I would that is here is a section tag to hold all of the content. Then right after this it would put my h1 - h6 tag here.
			Next comes 3 separate article tags and each of them would have one div.Then a h1-h6 tag followed by a paragraph Tag.

			<h2>Nav and CTA</h2>
			<p>This is for the users to navigate throughout the website and learn whats interesting over in the San Francisco area</p>
			<h2>Content Visualization</h2>
			<p>In this component we have the following: For the navigation bar there would be a header tag and a nav tag within that header
				Within that nav we have a unordered list with about 5 list tags. The first List tag would have another ul tag for the hamburger menu when clicked.
				The the second one would have a form and search button set up when clicked. The others should have a anchor tag that links to the correct page.
				As for the CTA I would say just a image tag altered with css.
